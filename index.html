              Every four years the world comes together to celebrate highs and lows of soccer.
              More than half the planet watched the 2018 tournament in Russia.
              FIFA, the sport's global governing body, orchestrates the process and <a href="https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/fifa-finances-2021-revenue/">rakes in billions</a>.

              Qatar is the host for the men's competition.
              Controversy has plagued the planning since the very moment it was awarded to them.
              It is so hot they were forced to reschedule to the cooler month of December.
              Their selection as a host was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/sports/soccer/qatar-and-russia-bribery-world-cup-fifa.html">due to extensive bribes</a>.

              The tiny nation has little soccer infrastruture, so they've brought in countless numbers of migrant labor to
              create 8 new stadiums, with few protections and

              But for many of the players, and fans, this is the chance of a lifetime.
              So instead of celebrating Qatar and FIFA this year, let's focus on them.
              Every World Cup fan has a story about the joys of connecting with someone from across the globe,
              learning about their culture, community, and journey.

              Then get out there and taste their food, listen to their music, support their restaurants, and learn from their home.
              Celebrate their cultures, instead of FIFA's corruption.
              Make it <em>Our Cup</em>.
