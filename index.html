              We are A Trike Called Funk, a creative collaboration of artistic expression, movement and a trike-based 
              sound system that creates community in public spaces. Our trike has wheeled from parks to beaches to 
              weddings and more, bringing the funk wherever it goes.

              Aaron Myers and Ed Word Galan, the dynamic duo behind our organization, arrive first on the scene, ready to jam!

              <br/>
              Other DJs and music venues might depend on electricity or a permit, but our battery-powered sound system and 
              portable dance floor help us bring the funk almost anywhere.

              We have seen movement bring people together in our work.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              As Aaron puts it, “Movement says more than you could say in words, it builds a sense of community, 
              bridges people who might see themselves in different groups or communities.”

              But if dancing isn’t for you, our activations 
              offer the opportunity to unleash your creativity with sidewalk chalk or instruments.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              To promote all forms of expression, we host local artists’ workshops, 
              dance lessons and guest speakers.

              When everything is set up, our M.C. A.a.ron introduces A Trike Called Funk 
              and shouts out this event’s partner. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              A.a.ron likes to start off the dancing, pulling in unsuspecting 
              onlookers and trying out whichever paint, chalk or instruments are 
              within reach.

              People can be a hesitant to bust a move with a crowd of strangers, 
              but A.a.ron’s charismatic enthusiasm usually gets them to come around.
              <br/>

              Kids are usually the first to get out on the floor…

              Anyone can get down with us, because our activations take advantage of 
              public spaces available to everyone. They have taken place day and night, 
              at parks, beaches, farmer’s markets and more.

              In the coming year, we hope to further expand the variety of our activations. 
              We’re especially excited to explore educational experiences, like our past 
              workshops in cultural appreciation and hip-hop at Suffolk University.

              At the end of the day, our activations are about unleashing creativity, 
              connecting people and building community.
