# Behind The Scenes: How We Get Funky

This is a behind-the-scenes look at a typical [A Trike Called Funk](https://www.atrikecalledfunk.com/) activation. We walk through who A Trike Called Funk is, what a typical activation looks like and how users can get in touch to learn more. This website was created as a part of our first sketch for Coding for Digital Storytelling at Northeastern University.
